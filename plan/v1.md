Here's the updated V1 plan, now including Gemini checks for sexual abuse in `username`, `firstName`, and `surname` in addition to image abuse detection. The plan remains focused on building a core authentication system with Node.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, NodeMailer, and Gemini API integration.

### Updated V1 Plan Overview
The V1 version will develop a core authentication system with email-based verification, image upload with Gemini abuse detection, text verification, and JWT-based login authentication. It will use Node.js, MongoDB for data storage, Cloudinary for image uploads, NodeMailer with Gmail for emails, and Gemini API for detecting abuse or sexual content in images, usernames, first names, and surnames. The API will be RESTful, with JWT authentication expiring in 7 days.

#### User Document Schema
The User schema will be defined using Mongoose to store authentication and profile data.

#### API Endpoints and Functionality

##### 1. POST /api/register
- **Purpose**: Register a new user with email, password, username, first name, surname, and optional profile image.
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: User's email address.
  - `password`: User's password (to be hashed).
  - `username`: Unique username.
  - `firstName`: User's first name.
  - `surname`: User's surname.
  - `profileImage`: Optional file upload for profile picture.
- **Process**:
  - Validate email format, username uniqueness, and check for duplicate emails in MongoDB.
  - Hash the password using `bcrypt`.
  - Use Gemini API to check `username`, `firstName`, and `surname` for sexual abuse or inappropriate content; reject if detected.
  - If `profileImage` is provided, upload it to Cloudinary and use Gemini API to check for abuse or sexual content; reject if detected.
  - Generate a verification token and save user data (email, hashed password, username, firstName, surname, Cloudinary URL, verification token) in MongoDB.
  - Send a verification email using NodeMailer with a link (e.g., `/api/verify?token=xyz`).
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Registration successful. Please verify your email.", status: 201 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Email or username already exists", status: 400 }` or `{ message: "Inappropriate content detected", status: 400 }`
- **Security**: Use HTTPS, validate inputs, and secure Gemini API key.

##### 2. GET /api/verify?token=:token
- **Purpose**: Verify a user's email using the token sent in the email.
- **Query Parameter**:
  - `token`: Verification token generated during registration.
- **Process**:
  - Query MongoDB to find a user with the matching verification token.
  - If found and not expired, update the user’s `isVerified` field to `true` and remove the token.
  - If token is invalid or expired, return an error.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Email verified successfully. You can now log in.", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Invalid or expired token", status: 400 }`
- **Security**: Ensure token expiration (e.g., 24 hours) and use secure token generation.

##### 3. POST /api/login
- **Purpose**: Authenticate a user and issue a JWT token.
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: User's email address.
  - `password`: User's password.
- **Process**:
  - Find user in MongoDB by email and check `isVerified`.
  - Compare the provided password with the hashed password using `bcrypt`.
  - If valid, generate a JWT token with a 7-day expiration using `jsonwebtoken`, including user ID and email.
  - Return the token in the response.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Login successful", token: "jwt-token-here", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Invalid credentials or unverified email", status: 401 }`
- **Security**: Use HTTPS and store JWT in `HttpOnly` cookies or as a bearer token.

##### 4. POST /api/text-verify
- **Purpose**: Send a text-based verification code (simulated via email as a placeholder).
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: User's email address.
- **Process**:
  - Generate a random 6-digit code and store it in MongoDB with an expiration (e.g., 10 minutes).
  - Send the code to the user's email using NodeMailer.
  - Return a success message.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Verification code sent to your email", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "User not found", status: 404 }`
- **Security**: Ensure code is unique and expires quickly.

##### 5. POST /api/verify-text
- **Purpose**: Verify the text-based code entered by the user.
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: User's email address.
  - `code`: 6-digit verification code.
- **Process**:
  - Check MongoDB for a matching email and code that hasn’t expired.
  - If valid, update the user’s `isTextVerified` field to `true` and remove the code.
  - If invalid or expired, return an error.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Text verification successful", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Invalid or expired code", status: 400 }`
- **Security**: Limit attempts to prevent brute force.

##### 6. PUT /api/update-profile
- **Purpose**: Update a user's profile image (requires JWT authentication).
- **Request Body**:
  - `profileImage`: New file upload for profile picture.
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization`: Bearer JWT token.
- **Process**:
  - Verify JWT token to authenticate the user.
  - Upload the new `profileImage` to Cloudinary.
  - Use Gemini API to check for abuse or sexual content; reject if detected.
  - Update the user’s `profileImageUrl` in MongoDB with the new Cloudinary URL.
  - Optionally delete the old image from Cloudinary.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Profile updated successfully", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Unauthorized or inappropriate image", status: 401 }`
- **Security**: Validate token and handle upload errors.

##### 7. DELETE /api/delete-account
- **Purpose**: Delete a user's account (requires JWT authentication).
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization`: Bearer JWT token.
- **Process**:
  - Verify JWT token to authenticate the user.
  - Find and delete the user document from MongoDB.
  - Optionally delete the associated profile image from Cloudinary.
- **Response**:
  - Success: `{ message: "Account deleted successfully", status: 200 }`
  - Error: `{ message: "Unauthorized or user not found", status: 401 }`
- **Security**: Double-check user ID from token and require confirmation.

#### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Node.js Setup**: Use Express.js with middleware like `express-jwt` for token validation.
- **MongoDB**: Use Mongoose with the following User schema:
  - `email`: String, required, unique.
  - `password`: String, required (hashed).
  - `username`: String, required, unique.
  - `firstName`: String, required.
  - `surname`: String, required.
  - `profileImageUrl`: String, optional.
  - `isVerified`: Boolean, default: false.
  - `isTextVerified`: Boolean, default: false.
  - `verificationToken`: String, optional.
  - `textVerificationCode`: String, optional, with expiration.
- **Cloudinary**: Configure with API keys for image uploads and deletions.
- **NodeMailer**: Set up with Gmail SMTP using environment variables for credentials.
- **Gemini API**: Integrate for detecting abuse or sexual content in images (during registration and profile updates) and in `username`, `firstName`, and `surname` (during registration).
- **JWT**: Store secret key in environment variables with a 7-day expiration.
